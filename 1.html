<h2>HTML</h2>
Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for creating
web pages and web applications.Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web
server or from local storage and render them into multimedia web pages.
HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally
included cues for the appearance of the document. HTML elements are the
building blocks of HTML pages.

uch as interactive forms, may be embedded into the rendered page. It provides
a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for
text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items.
HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle bracket
